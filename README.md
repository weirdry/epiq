- Embark on epic journeys (projects) filled with multiple quests
- Level up your character by completing quests and gaining experience
- Unlock achievements and earn rewards for consistent quest completion
- Track your progress with a visually appealing quest log
- Collaborate with fellow adventurers (team members) on group quests

## Tech Stack

- React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Firebase for backend and authentication
- PWA for cross-platform compatibility
